# TileGameWorld
/**
 * This is a game design project that I did with my teammate.
 * The project is to create a 2D Tile-based game that looks like Minecraft.
 * My job is to implement Engine.java, Space.java, Main.java, and Tileset.java
 * My partner's job is TERenderer.java and TETile.java
 * The challenge that I faced is to take care of the bounds of the world when trying to genrate it randomly.
 * There are several features implemented to make the game fun to play, such as setting the world to be night time.
 * You can also change appearance of the avatar.
 * You can also save the game and load back in later.
