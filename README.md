/**
 * This is a game design project that I did with my teammate.
 * The project is to create a 2D Tile-based game that looks like Minecraft.
 * My job is to implement Engine.java, Space.java, Main.java, and Tileset.java
 * My partner's job is TERenderer.java and TETile.java
 * The challenge that I faced is to take care of the bounds of the world when trying to generate it randomly.
 * There are several features implemented to make the game fun to play, such as setting the world to be night time.
 * You can also change appearance of the avatar.
 * You can also save the game and load back in later.

### Motivation
This project is one of the course projects from Artificial Intelligence course at UC Berkeley.  I have already had Machine Learning (ML) related project in another course Optimization at the same university. This time my job is to train a model to classify digits written by humans. It is essential for me because the project is challenging as it contains hyperparameters that I have to consistently change in order to maximize accuracy of classifying digits correctly. In the end, the classifer can reach accuracy to 97.6% using the testing set.

### Description
- Developed a Tile-based 2D game using Data Structures in Java that generates a random world.
- Integrated WeightedQuickUnionUF to connect in-game spaces.
- Designed an main menu and added extra features for better in-game experiences.
- Gained Software Engineering experience by applying engineering principles to solve problems to complete software projects in best practices.
